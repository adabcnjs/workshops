## Workshop: Clean code

https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/AdaBcnJS/events/251277658/

## Workshop

Everyone wants to code, and anyone can code... but can anyone understand our code? Every day more and more companies are starting to look for developers who follow best practices, and writing clean code is the most important best practice that we should follow.

Clean Code, a book written by Robert C. Martin in 2008, has become a key reference for programmers.

This will be a session led by Beatriz Mart√≠n, JavaScript Technical Lead at AXA IT, in which we'll share, discuss, and try to give sense to what Clean Code is, and how to start writing it. We will "clean" dirty code from practical examples and have some fun while doing it too.

_"Be smart. Be clean. Be simple. Ship! And keep a small roll of duct tape at the ready, and don't be afraid to use it."_ - Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin)

_"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."_ - Martin Fowler, 2008

## Required:

- Basic programming knowledge
- Bring your laptop!
