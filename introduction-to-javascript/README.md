## Taller

ES6/ES2015 is the 6th edition of ECMAScript, the language specification implemented and standardized by JavaScript, released in 2015.

ES6 brought with it many significant changes to JavaScript (which are not fully supported by all internet browsers yet): some nice, some cool, and some awesome, such as arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, promises, and many more.

This will be a very practical, learn-by-doing, kata-based, hands-on workshop led by Paqui Calabria, Senior Frontend Developer at AXA IT.

Required:

- Programming knowledge (JavaScript is a plus)

- Bring your laptop!

## Recursos

To do the exercises you can use a online platform like [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/?js,console), [codepen](https://codepen.io) or many more.
